## Description
**MyMilestoneCard** is a lightweight React application that helps you track day‑to‑day expenses and celebrate progress toward personal or team milestones. Add purchases, categorize them, and instantly see a running total alongside a printable receipt. Milestones—like staying under a weekly budget or reaching a savings target—are surfaced through a clean, card‑style interface so you always know where you stand. The project is intentionally simple to clone and run, yet structured for growth: components are small, accessible, and covered by basic tests, and the styling is minimal so it’s easy to customize. Whether you’re learning React, prototyping a finance feature, or managing pocket money, MyMilestoneCard gives you a fast starting point with sensible defaults and welcoming contribution guidelines. Extend it with cloud storage, authentication, or exports when you’re ready.
